# Behavior Tree Best Practices

## 1. Purpose & Overview

### Purpose
Provide clear guidance on using behavior trees (BTs) to structure AI agents. Explain how BTs help organize complex decision making into modular, reusable units.

### Overview
Briefly introduce BT core concepts (leaf behaviors, composites, decorators) and the value of non-blocking design, modularity, and introspection.

## 2. Core Principles of Behavior Implementation

### Minimal Constructor
Keep the __init__ method lightweight. It should only set up identifiers and minimal configuration necessary for offline rendering (e.g. for generating dot graphs).

### Delayed Initialization via setup()
Move heavy or external resource initialization (e.g. hardware, network connections, or middleware interfaces) into a separate setup() method. This ensures that your tree remains decoupled from runtime dependencies until execution.

### State Reset in initialise()
Use initialise() to reset or clear state, start timers, or perform just-in-time discovery. This makes behaviors re-entrant and prepares them for repeated execution.

### Lightweight update() Method
The update() function should be non-blocking and efficient—its job is to check conditions, perform small actions, and quickly return a status (RUNNING, SUCCESS, or FAILURE). Avoid any long-running or blocking operations here.

### Proper Cleanup in terminate()
When a behavior’s state changes (e.g. a higher-priority branch interrupts a running behavior), ensure that the terminate() method cleans up or resets any temporary state to avoid dangling actions.

## 3. Modular Tree Structure & Components

### Leaf Nodes

#### Action/Check Behaviors
Focus on very specific tasks or condition checks. Each leaf should have a narrow focus.

### Composites

#### Sequences & Selectors
Use sequences to chain actions that must succeed in order and selectors to choose among alternative behaviors.

#### Parallel Composites
When you need to tick multiple children “at once” (conceptually), use parallels but ensure that each child remains non-blocking.

#### Best Practice
Prefer reusing the standard composite types rather than creating new ones—this minimizes cognitive overhead when debugging.

### Decorators
Use decorators to modify behavior outcomes (e.g. inverters, retry patterns, timeout guards). They help “wear different hats” on the same basic behavior without duplicating code.

### BT Idioms
Leverage common patterns (often referred to as idioms) that py_trees provides:

#### Either-Or
For first-come-first-served conditional branching.

#### Oneshot
To ensure a particular branch is executed to completion only once.

#### Pick Up Where You Left Off
To allow long-running tasks to resume after an interruption.

These idioms help standardize solutions to recurring design challenges.

## 4. Error Handling, Recovery, and Robustness

### Fallback/Recovery Nodes
Design dedicated fallback or recovery subtrees to handle unexpected failures. If a key behavior fails, a fallback node can gracefully restore or reset the agent’s state.

### Interruptions & High-Priority Switches
Ensure that high-priority behaviors can interrupt lower-priority ones safely. When a higher-priority branch preempts an ongoing task, the lower branch’s terminate() method should reset its state.

### Blackboard Usage

#### Shared State
Use a central blackboard for passing data between behaviors.

#### Namespaces & Remapping
Organize keys with namespaces to avoid collisions, and use remappings when integrating external modules.

#### Dynamic Updates
Behaviors can both read and write to the blackboard, so use it for state tracking, progress indicators, or debugging data.

## 5. Debugging, Logging, and Visualization

### Logging
Incorporate logging inside key methods (initialise(), update(), terminate()) to capture transitions and decision points. This is critical for diagnosing issues during development.

### Visualization

#### Dot Graphs
Render your tree to dot graphs for a high-level view of structure and behavior.

#### Visitors & Tick Handlers
Use pre-tick and post-tick handlers (with snapshot or debug visitors) to monitor the state of your tree during execution.

#### Blackbox & Visibility Levels
For large trees, use techniques like “blackboxes” to hide details and focus on the big picture.

## 6. Integrating with AI Agent Architecture

### Initialization Node
A dedicated behavior at the root (or in a dedicated subtree) for configuration, version checking, and setting up the blackboard.

### Plan Node
A subtree responsible for generating a structured plan (potentially via LLM calls). Use idioms like “oneshot” to ensure a plan is generated only once until updated.

### Execution/Validation Node
A branch that executes the plan and validates its outputs. Use sequences to ensure each step completes successfully, and fallback nodes to handle errors.

### Fallback/Recovery Node
Incorporate a fallback branch to recover from errors, restore context, or re-initiate the planning process when necessary.

### Resumable Tasks
Implement “pick up where you left off” patterns for tasks that may be interrupted by higher-priority events, ensuring a smooth resumption.

## 7. Performance and Best Practices

### Non-Blocking Design
Ensure that every tick of your BT is fast. Offload heavy computation or blocking operations to separate threads or asynchronous processes.

### Tick Rate Recommendations
Adjust your tick rate (e.g., 1–500 ms per tick) based on the complexity and responsiveness needed for your application.

### Modularity & Reusability
Keep behaviors small and composable. Reuse idioms and standard composites to avoid “spaghetti” logic.

### Testing & Simulation
Stub out parts of your tree with dummy behaviors during design. Use offline rendering (dot graphs) and logging to verify tree logic before deployment.

## 8. Conclusion
Summarize by emphasizing that a well-structured BT not only improves the reliability and maintainability of your AI agent but also enhances the ability to debug and scale the system. The practices outlined here—drawn from extensive documentation and practical demos—will help you create robust, clear, and efficient behavior trees for your AI agents.
