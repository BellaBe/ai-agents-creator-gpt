# Memory Management Guidelines for AI Agents

## 1. Overview

### Short-Term Memory (STM)
The immediate, context-driven storage corresponding to an agent's current task or dialogue window.

### Long-Term Memory (LTM)
A more persistent store that can hold knowledge indefinitely.

### Behavior Tree Integration
A shared data store (blackboard) can hold both STM and pointers to LTM.

## 2. Short-Term Memory

### 2.1 Context Window and Token Budgeting
- Maintain Recent Interactions
- Token Budget Management

### 2.2 Blackboard Systems
```python
import py_trees

# Initialize a blackboard for the agent
blackboard = py_trees.blackboard.Blackboard()
blackboard.conversation_history = "User asked about travel recommendations."
blackboard.current_goal = "Plan a weekend getaway."
```

## 3. Long-Term Memory

### 3.1 Vector Databases for RAG
```python
def store_memory(vector_db, text, embedding_func):
    embedding = embedding_func(text)
    vector_db.insert(embedding, metadata={"text": text})

def retrieve_memory(vector_db, query, embedding_func, top_k=5):
    query_embedding = embedding_func(query)
    results = vector_db.search(query_embedding, top_k=5)
    return [r["metadata"]["text"] for r in results]
```

## 4. Memory as Blackboard
A blackboard can serve as a unifying interface for both short-term and long-term memory:

LLM Planning Node:
Reads the high-level goal and current state from the blackboard, produces a plan, and writes it back.

Tool Action Nodes:
Read specific parameters from the blackboard (e.g., a search query) and write results (e.g., an article summary) back.

Memory Organization:
Maintain separate sections for short-term (memory["short_term"]) and long-term (memory["long_term"]) or use specialized keys (memory["current_plan"], memory["knowledge_base"], etc.).

## 5. Memory Lifecycle
Effective memory management goes beyond storage: it includes continuous processes for writing, pruning/consolidation, and reading/retrieval.

### 5.1 Writing
Action Results:
Write task outputs, new subgoals, or significant observations to memory in real time.
Reflections and Summaries:
After completing a subtask, store a brief summary or reflection to assist future decision-making.

### 5.2 Management (Pruning/Consolidation)
Avoid Memory Bloat:
Remove outdated or trivial information periodically.
Summarize and Merge:
Convert detailed logs into concise notes and merge related facts to keep the most critical knowledge accessible.

### 5.3 Reading / Retrieval
Behavior Tree Integration:
Use a dedicated node to query memory based on the current goal or context.
Semantic Search (Tool Use):
Employ embedding-based similarity searches to pull relevant entries. Insert these results back into STM (the prompt) to guide planning and action.

## 6. Long-Term Adaptability
As the agent accumulates experiences, it adapts over time:

Retaining Successful Strategies:
If a particular tool usage or prompt style works well, store it in LTM for future reuse.
Learning from Failures:
After errors, prompt the LLM to reflect on the mistake and store a brief note in memory for next time.
Adaptive Behaviors:
The agent can modify parameters, tool preferences, or even parts of its behavior tree if it learns that certain approaches are more effective.

## 7. Multi-Agent Memory Management
When multiple agents collaborate:

Individual Memories:
Each agent keeps its own short-term and long-term records.
Shared Memory:
A global store can log collective knowledge or record key interactions, enabling agents to stay aware of each other’s progress and avoid duplicating work.

## 8. Hybrid Memory Systems
Combining short-term and long-term memory creates a robust, scalable solution:

Immediate Context:
Use the blackboard to keep track of the latest interactions, goals, and partial outputs.
Periodic Summarization:
Every few steps, summarize critical events from the blackboard and store them in a vector database or other LTM store.
Consolidated Retrieval:
When a new query arises, fetch recent context from STM (the blackboard) and relevant historical data from LTM (vector store, database).
Combined Prompt:
Merge the short-term context with relevant long-term knowledge to guide the LLM’s next response.

## 9. Best Practices & Considerations
Memory Decay and Pruning:
Implement logic to discard or down-weight older, less relevant memories.
Relevance Filtering:
Use the LLM or similarity scoring to prioritize which memories to include in the prompt.
Security and Privacy:
Store sensitive data securely, adhering to any organizational or regulatory requirements.
Versioning and Schema Management:
Keep track of changes in how memory data is structured or stored.
Regular Testing and Iteration:
Continuously evaluate whether the agent retrieves correct, relevant information and whether the summarization process remains effective.

## 10. Case Studies and Examples

### 10.1 Generative Agents
Approach:
Virtual characters maintain a continuous memory stream supplemented by periodic summarization and retrieval.
Key Takeaway:
Summarization routines and retrieval methods combine to simulate human-like memory, enabling more coherent and context-driven responses.

### 10.2 AutoGPT-Like Implementations
Approach:
Employ vector databases to store past conversations and action logs, enabling retrieval of earlier context across extended tasks.
Key Takeaway:
Persistent storage plus retrieval significantly improves performance in long-running, multi-step tasks.

## 11. Conclusion
By systematically managing short-term and long-term memory, AI agents built on large language models can:
- Retain context over extended conversations
- Recall historical insights to inform new actions
- Adapt based on past success and failure
