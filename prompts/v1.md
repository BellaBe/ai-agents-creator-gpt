# AI Agent Prompts

## Simple Agent Example
Generate a simple AI agent that uses a behavior tree to plan and execute a task via the OpenAI API. Include an initialization node and a fallback recovery node.

## Multi-Agent Coordination
Create a multi-agent system where one agent plans and delegates tasks while another executes and validates actions. Show how they communicate through shared memory in a behavior tree structure.

## Memory-Enhanced Agent
Build an AI agent that incorporates both short-term memory (using a blackboard) and long-term memory (using a vector database) to maintain context over multiple interactions.

## Tool Integration
Develop an AI agent that uses external tools for web search and code execution. Demonstrate how LLM function calling is used to fetch real-time data and perform actions.

## Self-Reflective Agent
Design an autonomous AI agent that self-reflects on its plan by validating its steps via LLM calls. Include fallback nodes for when the validation fails.

## Comprehensive Blueprint
Provide a complete blueprint for an AI agent that integrates planning, execution, memory management, and safety checks using behavior trees, with examples of LLM calls through OpenAI and Groq APIs.

## Security and Safety Focus
Generate an AI agent blueprint that emphasizes:
- Security and safety
- Input sanitization
- Sandboxed tool calls
- Robust fallback mechanisms
Within the behavior tree structure.
